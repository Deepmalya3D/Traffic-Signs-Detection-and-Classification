This would enable autonomous vehicles to follow traffic rules and regulations, analyzing every sign whether it\u2019s about speed limit or stop and go indications to safely navigate the roads.\n\n**Traffic Rule Compliance:** This model can be used in driver assistance systems to ensure that drivers comply with all traffic rules. Alerts can be generated when drivers exceed the speed limit or don\u0027t stop at red lights, fostering safer roads.\n\n**Road Safety Training Programs:** Driving schools and automotive companies can build simulations and education programs using this model. These programs can offer practical guidance to new drivers on identifying and responding to different traffic signs, thus enhancing road safety knowledge.\n\n**Smart City Infrastructure:** City authorities could use this model in connected CCTV or IoT infrastructure to track and monitor traffic compliance in real-time, helping identify areas with frequent rules violation for potential improvement.\n\n**Road Network Analysis:** Transportation engineering researchers can use this model to analyze how efficiently different sign classes are distributed and recognized around the city. This data can be instrumental in planning more efficient and safer road networks.\n\nYou can use the following link to download this dataset in other formats and also to access its original file: \nhttps://universe.roboflow.com/selfdriving-car-qtywx/self-driving-cars-lfjou"}
